# Summary
**Guillemot** is a probabilistic programming language designed for binary, discrete, and discretized continuous distributions (continuous distributions are not supported). It supports both search (exact) and direct search (approximate) inference, however, development has focused on exact inference.

Additonally, Guillemot includes elimination commands to marginalize or eliminate certain remaining variables, reducing the search tree space.


## Assumptions

1. Properly formatted Guillemot program as input
2. A *return* statement must occur within the program, but one or more *observation* statements are not required.


## Setup




## Usage



## References

Available in *references.md* as well as in the code. In the case of a code piece utilized multiple times but only used from another resource once (e.g. a stack overflow reference), only the first time is mentioned.
